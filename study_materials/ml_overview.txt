Types of machine learning 
Supervised learning: classification & regression and unsupervised learning: clustering.
Supervised Learning
Definition: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The training dataset includes input-output pairs, and the model learns to make predictions or decisions based on this data. Example: predict housing prices based on the size of the house using historical data of house prices labeld with their size.
Unsupervised Learning
Definition: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, and the system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any labels.
Classification
A supervised learning task that involves predicting the class or category of an object or sample based on its features. Classification algorithms are used when the output is a category such as ‘spam’ or ‘not spam’, ‘fraudulent’ or ‘not fraudulent’. The algorithm learns from the training data and applies the knowledge to classify new, unseen data. Example: Email Spam Detection: classifying emails as spam or not spam. Algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN): Used for classifying objects based on closest training examples in the feature space. Naive Bayes: Used for classification with an assumption of independence among predictors.
Naive Bayes:
Definition: A classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors. More Information: It assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. This assumption simplifies the computation, and that’s why it is considered as "naive". Example: Spam email detection where the features are the presence of certain words, and the classes are spam and not spam.
k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN):
Definition: It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. The number of neighbors, *k*, is a user-defined constant. A distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, is used to find the  nearest neighbors. Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on the similarity of their content to known spam and non-spam emails.
Regression
A supervised learning task that involves predicting a continuous quantity. Unlike classification, in regression, the output is a real or continuous value, such as ‘salary’, or ‘house price’. Regression algorithms predict the output values based on input features from the data fed in the system. Examples: House Price Prediction: Predicting the price of a house based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms. Algorithms: Univariate Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression, Univariate Polynomial Regression.
Univariate Linear Regression
Definition: A type of linear regression where there is a single independent variable to predict the dependent variable. More Information: It finds the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Example: Predicting house prices based on size.
Multivariate Linear Regression
Definition: A type of linear regression with two or more independent variables. More Information: It finds the best fit hyperplane that predicts the dependent variable. Example: Predicting house prices based on size, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood.
Univariate Polynomial Regression
Definition: A type of regression where the relationship between the independent and dependent variable is modeled as an *n*th degree polynomial. More Information: Useful for describing curvilinear relationships. Example: Predicting the growth of bacteria as a function of temperature, where the relationship is not linear, but can be modeled as a polynomial.
Clustering
Definition: An unsupervised learning task that involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. The goal is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters. Clustering is used in various applications such as market research, pattern recognition, data analysis, and image processing. Example: Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior. Algorithm: k-Means.
k-Means:
Definition: A partitioning method that divides a dataset into *k* clusters. More Information: Each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm iteratively assigns points to clusters and recalculates the cluster centroids. Example: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
