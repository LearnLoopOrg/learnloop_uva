Introduction
• The nervous system is made up of two basic
kinds of cells
• Glia
• Neurons
Building blocks of the nervous
system
Neuron

Building blocks of the nervous
system
• Different types of neurons
• Sensory receptors
• Sensory (afferent) neurons
• Motor (efferent) neurons
• Interneurons

• Neurons either fire or do not fire
• All‐or‐none law
• Intensity variations by
• variations in the number of neurons firing.
• variations in firing rate.
• Neurons interact
• via synapses.
• through chemical substances.
Communication among neurons
• Synapse
• the place where a signal passes from one nerve
cell to another
Communication among neurons
• Synapse
• the place where a signal passes from one nerve
cell to another
Communication among neurons
• Neurotransmitters
• Chemical substances that transmit signals from
one neuron to another
• Lock‐and‐key Model
• Effect is terminated by
• autoreceptors
• synaptic reuptake
• enzymes
Communication among neurons
• Neurotransmitters
• Chemical substances that transmit signals from
one neuron to another
• The binding of a neurotransmitter with a receptor produces an
excitatory or inhibitory signal.
Communication among neurons
• Neurotransmitters
Communication among neurons
• Drugs
• Agonists
• Increase of precursor
• counteracting the cleanup enzymes
• blocking the re‐uptake
• mimicking the transmitter’s action
• Antagonists
• decrease precursor (or neurotransmitter)
• increase effectiveness cleanup enzymes
• enhance the re‐uptake
• blocking of receptors

Studying the brain
• 19th century ‐> Phrenology
• Bumps on the skull were interpreted in terms of
personality traits.
