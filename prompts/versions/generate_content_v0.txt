Task Description:
Given is a list with a concept on top and its definition below it. For each concept in the list, generate a short infotext that explains the concept and a question to test if the student understood the concept. For the question you should make a concise answer rubric in which you assign points to the important parts of the answer.
Give your response in JSON format which structure consists of an array called "segments", where each element is an object representing either an "info" segment with a "title" and "text", or a "question" segment with a "question" and "answer". Ensure each segment object includes the "type" key to specify its category, and separate each segment within the array with a comma.

Example input:
neurotransmitters
Chemical substances that transmit signals from one neuron to another.
receptors
In neurons, specialized protein molecules on the postsynaptic membrane; neurotransmitters bind to these molecules after passing across the synapse.
reuptake
The process whereby a neurotransmitter is taken back into the presynaptic terminal buttons, thereby stopping its activity.

Example output:

    "segments":[
    {
        "type": "info",
        "title": "Neurotransmitters",
        "text": "Neurotransmitters are chemical substances that transmit signals from one neuron to another."
