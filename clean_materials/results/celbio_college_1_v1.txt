 Good morning, and welcome to everyone present. I trust that my voice is reaching you clearly. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Michel Haring, and it is my privilege to guide you through several chapters of "Molecular Biology of the Cell" over the coming weeks. My goal is to kindle your enthusiasm for the molecular mechanisms that enable our cells to function effectively.

Our course is segmented into units, and we will commence with Module 3. This module encompasses a variety of fundamental processes that are vital for cellular function, with a particular focus on the molecular aspects. As we discuss cells, our conversation is inherently linked to molecules. The principles we will examine are outlined here.

The most significant message I aim to convey pertains to the mechanisms within the cell that are essential for targeting the proteins necessary for cellular function to their appropriate locations. It is imperative to understand what knowledge of these processes is required, how certain proteins operate, and if possible, to relate this understanding to specific disease pathologies. This contextualization will provide a clearer rationale for learning these molecular processes.

The textbook we will utilize for this course is "The Cell." I noticed a copy of "Neuroscience" by Purves, which I believe is also part of your curriculum. This book is relevant to a second-year developmental biology course, which similarly addresses many of the processes we will be discussing. In this course, we will review Chapters 11, 12, 13, and 15. While we may not cover every detail, the material is extensive and may be new to many of you.

 It may indeed be quite complex. Therefore, it is advisable to review the PowerPoint slides I am currently using in advance to familiarize yourself with the content. I hope you have them open now to take notes and pay attention when I emphasize certain points as important, understanding that these elements may potentially be included in exam questions. I recommend this approach as part of your preparation. We will undertake four activities during this course.

Currently, we are at this juncture in the module, with a number of lectures still to come. All the PowerPoint slides for these lectures are available on Canvas for you to peruse. The module will conclude in the same manner as you have seen before. There will be a session for questions, where you can inquire about any aspect of the material, ensuring that we have collectively understood it correctly.

A notable topic is the introduction to Gene Cards, which serves as a prelude to an assignment that will be given to you. This assignment involves exploring a website called Gene Cards, which contains a wealth of information about proteins or genes, depending on the focus of your research. Our primary interest will be in proteins. This database is an invaluable resource for information. In the future, you will also be working with such databases. The purpose of using this resource in our course is to consolidate all the information provided about protein localization and function into a coherent whole. When investigating a single protein, which aspects of the curriculum will you encounter? It is hoped that this approach will make the subject matter more tangible and realistic.

Moreover, we are using a textbook as a core resource, which typically lags five to ten years behind current knowledge. In contrast, a website like Gene Cards may only be two to three years out of date, bringing you closer to the current state of scientific understanding. While the website may be more complex than the textbook, potentially leading to confusion, that is not the intention. The objective is for you to contextualize all the information presented.

The Gene Cards assignment is central to this endeavor. Periodically, I will revisit specific themes or topics that I believe are particularly relevant to our lectures, such as Alzheimer's disease. Given your interest in psychobiology, it is likely you have already engaged with the subject of Alzheimer's to some extent.

 The primary post-mortem observation in Alzheimer's disease is that the brain exhibits significant structural changes. It is understood that the accumulation of certain proteins plays a pivotal role, resulting in a disruption of cellular communication. This protein accumulation, coupled with cellular alterations, leads to the development of Alzheimer's disease, which can manifest in various forms.

The lectures aim to occasionally reference this process to facilitate recognition of these disruptions. For example, when protein transport is compromised, the progression of Alzheimer's disease is likely to ensue. The course also attempts to draw connections to Alzheimer's disease and, at times, to other pathological conditions. To further explore these topics, students may follow provided online links for additional information. 

It is important to note the recurring mention of proteins in the literature on Alzheimer's disease, particularly alpha and beta proteins of lengths 40 and 42. Extensive research has contributed to our understanding of these proteins, revealing their regulatory role on various membrane proteins within the synapse, components that we will revisit throughout the course. 

The goal is to illustrate the elements of the pathological process in Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the course will address potential interventions, including pharmacological treatments. For instance, in 2016, an antibody known as Aducanumab was discovered, which was shown to reduce amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's and, consequently, ameliorate brain dysfunction. This finding suggested a potential to slow cognitive decline, although it is crucial to understand that slowing deterioration does not equate to improvement but rather a reduced rate of decline. 

The initial promise of Aducanumab in 2016 gave way to skepticism by 2019, as further research cast doubt on its efficacy as a treatment. By 2021, Aducanumab was no longer available in Europe. The course will delve into the mechanism of action of such antibodies and their role in the treatment landscape of Alzheimer's disease.
