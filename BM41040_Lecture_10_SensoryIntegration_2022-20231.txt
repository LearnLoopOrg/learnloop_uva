Challenges in Human Movement Control
• How do we control our limbs?
• Sensory Integration!

Challenges in Human Movement Control
• Redundancy
• 600 muscles controlling 200 joints
• Noise
• Sensor and motor noise
• Delays
• Neural transportation and processing
• Uncertainty
• Incomplete knowledge of environment
• Nonstationarity
• Growth, fatigue, and aging
• Nonlinearity
• Mapping between muscles vs. endpoint
And what about
robot control?

Redundancy
• Muscle redundancy
• More muscles than DoF
• Kinematic redundancy
• Multiple paths to same position
• Postures with same hand position
• Sensor redundancy
• Multiple sensors measure same
variable
Trumbower et al. (2009)

Motor noise
• Finger pushes on force sensor
• Visual feedback on force
• Standard deviation of force signal (the
motor noise!) is proportional with the
applied force
• Motor noise increases with force level
• signal dependent noise
• Coefficient of variation depends on MVC
O’Sullivan et al. (2009)

Sensory integration
• Multiple sensors and sensor types provide ‘redundant’ information
about the same quantity
• e.g. location of hand in space
• Vision
• Proprioception
• Sensory input can be
• Noisy
• Ambiguous
• What are the computations to
integrate the sensory inputs?
11 |
Today’s contents
• Senses and sensory integration
• Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
• Integration of visual and proprioceptive information
• Integration of proprioceptive information from different sensors
• Sensory reweighting in balance control
12 |
Integration of sensory information from
different sensors
• Location of one’s own body parts in peri-personal space
• Vision
• Proprioception
• Balance control
• Vestibular system
• Vision
• Proprioception
• Haptics
• Proprioception
• Touch (tactile system)
• Vision

• Example: (blindly) point to a learned position
